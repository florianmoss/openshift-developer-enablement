## Introduction
The content for this week is based on the official [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKAD_Curriculum_v1.22.pdf) curriculum content. I am adding on top of it a few pieces around the general Kubernetes architecture that I believe are important to understand.

It is not essential that you can remember every single detail from this week, but understand general idea and how Kubernetes works.

OpenShift will make interacting with a lot of these concepts significantly easier.
